# Git Interaction Rules

## Commits
- Do NOT make any Git commits or push to the repository unless explicitly instructed by the user.
- If a commit is required, always ask for user approval and provide a clear commit message for review.

## Branching
- Do NOT create new branches without explicit user instruction.
- Do NOT merge branches or resolve conflicts without user approval.

## Repository Management
- Do NOT perform any Git operations that modify the remote repository (push, pull, merge) without explicit user instruction.
- Always inform the user about intended Git operations before executing them.

## Pull Requests
- Do NOT create, merge, or close pull requests unless specifically requested by the user.
- Always seek clarification on pull request requirements and approvals.

## Branch Management
- Always stay in the development branch.
- After merging or syncing branches to equalize versions, automatically return to the development branch unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
